## Nib File (NeXTStep Interface Builder)
A nib is a file, in a special format, consisting of instructions for creating and configuring instances. The nib-loading process creates and configures the instances, and you receive the instances and then insert them into your app's interface.

## Scene, View and View Controller 
In a sotryboard file, the primary constituents are scenes. Each view controller in a storyboard file constitutes one scene. A scene is, roughly speaking, a single view controller, along with some ancillary material; every scene has a single view controller at tis top level.

A view Controller isn't an interface object, but it manages an interface object, namely its view (or main view). When view controller is shown in the nib editor, its main view usually appears inside the view controller in the canvas.
